# ⚡ Energy Demand Forecasting using Time Series Analysis

Analysis

📌 Project Overview

A utility company wanted to predict electricity demand accurately to optimize power generation and distribution. The project involved analyzing historical electricity demand, weather conditions, and holiday patterns to develop a robust forecasting model.

🎯 Objective

Accurately forecast electricity demand.

Optimize power generation and distribution.

Reduce operational costs and prevent energy shortages during peak periods.

🛠️ Approach

Data Collection 📊

Historical electricity demand

Weather data

Holiday patterns

Modeling Techniques 🏗️

SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA): Captures seasonality and trends in the demand data.

Prophet: Facebook's forecasting model used for trend decomposition.

DeepAR: Amazon's deep-learning model for probabilistic forecasting with prediction intervals.

Implementation 🖥️

Data preprocessing and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib.

Time series forecasting models implemented in Python.

Model performance evaluation based on metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).

📈 Outcome

Achieved accurate demand forecasts.

Helped the utility company optimize energy distribution.

Reduced operational costs and prevented power shortages.
