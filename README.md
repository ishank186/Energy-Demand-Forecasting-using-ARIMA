# ⚡ Energy Demand Forecasting using Time Series Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
A utility company wanted to predict electricity demand accurately to optimize power generation and distribution. The project involved analyzing historical electricity demand, weather conditions, and holiday patterns to develop a robust forecasting model.

## 🎯 Objective
- Accurately forecast electricity demand.
- Optimize power generation and distribution.
- Reduce operational costs and prevent energy shortages during peak periods.

## 🛠️ Approach
1. **Data Collection** 📊
   - Historical electricity demand
   - Weather data
   - Holiday patterns
   
2. **Modeling Techniques** 🏗️
   - **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**: Captures seasonality and trends in the demand data.
   - **Prophet**: Facebook's forecasting model used for trend decomposition.
   - **DeepAR**: Amazon's deep-learning model for probabilistic forecasting with prediction intervals.

3. **Implementation** 🖥️
   - Data preprocessing and visualization using **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**.
   - Time series forecasting models implemented in **Python**.
   - Model performance evaluation based on metrics like **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**.

## 📈 Outcome
- Achieved accurate demand forecasts.
- Helped the utility company optimize energy distribution.
- Reduced operational costs and prevented power shortages.
